Preserves the category hierarchy on the post editing screen

== Description ==

On the post editing screen, after saving a post, you will notice that the checked categories are displayed on top, breaking the category hierarchy.

This plugin removes that "feature".

Just install and forget about it.

Unfortunately, it requires WordPress 2.9.
